The `range(n)` function in `Python` **generates** numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
> If you try to run the `range(n)` function to produce these values, it won't do anything because it is a so-called **generator** which means it will only produce the actual values within the context of a looping structure which sequentially requests the values.  This is actually clever because it means the actual numbers themselves don't actually have to be stored in memory anywhere, and can instead just be sequentially produced one at a time as needed. 

The `print()` function outputs a displays of its object argument. Since (as discussed above) `range(5)` is a so-called **generator**, if you run the code `print(range(5))`, you will get the following output. 

```python
range(0, 5) # output from running `print(range(5))`
```

The `for i in range(n):` template is the coding construct that is used used to specify the repetition of a block of code `n` times.

> The block of code that the `for` loop repeats will be executed "silently"; so, if you want to display anything inside of a `for` loop you need to explicitly use the `print()` function in the body of your `for` loop as demonstrated below.

```python
for i in range(5): # "iterates" `i` over the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    # the "body" of a `for` loop --
    # the "indented code block" below the `for` statement syntax
    print(i) # is executed sequentially for each value of the `i` "iterator"
```

> `Python` code WILL NOT WORK unless properly indented... this is an interesting "feature" of `Python` coding that helps to make code for readable!

Here's a step by step break down of what the `for` loop code above is doing.

1. Initialization: the `for` loop starts with the keyword `for`
2. Iterator Variable: `i` is the "iterator" variable that will sequentially change with each "iteration" of the `for` loop
3. The `range()` function: `range(5)` will "iteratively" generate the sequence of numbers from `0` to `4` (since `Python` uses "0-indexing"), and these will be sequentially assigned to "iterator" `u` 
4. Loop Body: the code block indented under the `for` loop defines what happens during each "iteration" (in this case, the sequentially assigned values of `i` will be printed)
5. Iteration Process:
    1. In the first iteration, `i` is set to `0`, the first number produced by the `range` generator.
    2. The `print(i)` statement is executed, printing `0` to the screen.
    3. The `for` loop now iterates by setting `i` is set to the next number produced by the `range` generator, which is `1`.
    4. `print(i)` is executed again, this time printing `1`.
    5. This process repeats until `i` has "iterated" through all of the values produced by the `range` generator.
6. Termination: once `i` has reached `4` there are no more `i` "iterations", the loop ends, and the program continues with any code following the loop.
