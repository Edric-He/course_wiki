FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge that’s often used to teach basic programming concepts like loops and conditionals. 
In the FizzBuzz problem, you loop through a range of numbers, and then do the follow for each number.
1. If the number is divisible by 3, you print “Fizz”.
2. If the number is divisible by 5, you print “Buzz”.
3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print “FizzBuzz”.
4. If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, you print the number itself.

Here’s an example FizzBuzz program that illustrates the use of `if` and `else` conditional statements for logical flow control with comments explaining each step.

```python
for i in range(1, 101):  # Loop from 1 to 100

    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:  # Check if divisible by both 3 and 5
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:  # Check if divisible by 3
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:  # Check if divisible by 5
        print("Buzz")
    else:  # If not divisible by 3 or 5
        print(i)
```

1. The `for` loop sets up the iteration (from `1` to `100` in this example).
2. The first `if` statement checks for the first condition (divisible by both 3 and 5).
    1. the **modulus** operation `%` returns the remainder of "i divided by 3"; so, it's just an operation like `i+3`, `i-3`, or `i/3`; but, if the remainder is `0` then it means that "i divides by 3 perfectly"
    2. The `and` construction in `i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0` means that both `i % 3 == 0` AND `i % 5 == 0` must be `True` for the `if` statement to succeed
    3. If the `if` statement succeeds (because its "argument is `True`) then the "body" (the indented code block beneath the `if` statement) of the `if` statement is executed
3. The next two `elif` ("else if") statements each subsequently sequentially check if their respective conditions (divisible by 3, and then 5) are true statements, and execute their code block "bodies" if so
    1. Using `elif` instead of `if` "connects" the logical statements into a single logical control flow sequence whose conditions can be understood in an "else if" manner that can help improve the clarity of the checks. 
4. The `else` statement covers the case where none of the above conditions are `True` and concludes the logical control flow sequence.
5. The `print()` function outputs the result based on the condition that’s met.

This structure allows the program to make decisions at each iteration, using logical flow control structures within a `for` loop to print out a mix of numbers and the words “Fizz”, “Buzz”, and “FizzBuzz” based on the divisibility of each number. 

### `Try-except` blocks

A similar logical flow control structure to `if`/`else` statements is the `try-except` block. Rather than checking for `True` conditions however, `try-except` blocks check for the presence of "run time errors" which are stored as a kind of `Python` object known as an `Exception`. In the code below, `Python` tries to run "one"/"two" but doesn't know how to do this; but, the `except Exception as e` construct allows the nature of the error to be captured as an `Exception` object and named `e` which can then be printed out and examined without cause the code to fail (as it would if you tried to run `"one"/"two"` without wrapping a `try-except` block around it). 

```python
try:
    "one"/"two"
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
