In statistics, a normal distribution is a fundamental concept that describes how data points are spread out. It is also known as the Gaussian distribution, named after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. The normal distribution is essential because it often appears in real-world data and underpins many statistical methods.

**Characteristics of a Normal Distribution**

A normal distribution has several key features:

- Symmetry: The distribution is perfectly symmetric about the mean.
- Central Tendency: The mean, median, and mode of the distribution are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.
- Bell-Shaped Curve: The distribution forms a bell-shaped curve, with the highest point at the mean.
- Spread: The spread of the distribution is determined by the standard deviation. A larger standard deviation means the data is more spread out from the mean, while a smaller standard deviation means the data is more clustered around the mean.
