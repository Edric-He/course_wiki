```python
# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame

# Drop rows with any missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Drop rows that have all missing values
df.dropna(how='all', inplace=True)

# Keep rows with at least 2 non-missing values
df.dropna(thresh=2, inplace=True)

# Remove an entire column named 'col' from df
del df['col']

# Or only drop columns that have any missing values
df.dropna(subset=['col1', 'col2'], axis='columns', inplace=True)
```

The order in which you remove rows or columns with missing values to some degree determines the number of non-missing values that are "thrown away" when rows and columns are removed... so proceed intentionally and cautiously to when removing data so you don't "unnecessarily" through away data when you're removing rows and columns from a dataset.
