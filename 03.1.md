A **bar plot** is a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights (or lengths) proportional to the values that they represent. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Sample data
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Categories': ['Category1', 'Category2', 'Category3'],
    'Values': [10, 20, 30]
})

# Create a bar plot with Plotly
fig = px.bar(df, x='Categories', y='Values', text='Values') 
# The bars can be plotted horizontally instead of vertically by switching `x` and `y`

# Show the plot
fig.show()
```

A bar plot is essentially a visual representation of the `.value_counts()` method of the `pandas` library.

> Remember, the `.value_counts()` is a method that produces counts of unique values (sorted in descending order starting with the most frequently-occurring element). The the `.value_counts()` method excludes missing values by default, but these can included by instead using `.value_counts(dropna=False)` with the additional `parameter=argument` specification.

```python
# Example data
data = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'd', 'a'], name="Variable")

# Use .value_counts()
counts = data.value_counts()

# Create bar plot with Plotly
fig = px.bar(counts, y=counts.values, x=counts.index, text=counts.values)
fig.update_layout(title_text='Value Counts', xaxis_title='Categories', yaxis_title='Count')
# This updates the layout to add a title and labels to the x and y axes to make the plot more immediately sensible
fig.show()
```

In this code, we first count the occurrences of each category in the series using `.value_counts()`. Then, we create a bar plot with `px.bar()`. The `y` argument is set to the counts (the number of occurrences of each category), and the `x` argument is set to the index of the counts (the categories themselves). The `text` argument is used to display the count numbers on top of the bars. For example, the height of the 'a' bar is the count of 'a' in the dataset. 

> A **bar plot** is a simple way to understand the distribution of categorical data that is a good alternative to just reading `df.value_counts()`.
>
> And with interactive `plotly` bar plots, you can hover over the bars to see the exact counts, and you can also zoom in and out, and save the plot as a png file.

The **mode** in statistics is the value (or values) that appears most frequently in a data set. In the bar plot above 'a' is the mode since it appears most frequently in the dataset. 

> The term "modes" is also used to refer to "peaks" in a distribution of data... this will be discussed later in the context of "multimodality"
