```python
import pandas as pd

titanic_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv')

titanic_df.shape # number of rows and columns 
# this is an "attribute" not a "method" so it does not have end with parenthesis `()`

titanic_df.columns # number of rows and columns 
# also an attribute...

# You can rename columns as desired...
# This would make columns named "a" and "b" uppercase
df.rename(columns={'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}, inplace=True)

# The `{'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}` is a "dictionary" `dict()` data type object.
# In dictionary parlance, the lowercase letters in the above example are "keys" 
# and the uppercase letters are the "values" which correspond the to the "keys"

# In this case, the code specifies the columns to be renamed (the keys)
# and what their new names should be (the values).
