```python
import pandas as pd

titanic_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv')

titanic_df.shape # number of rows and columns 
# this is an "attribute" not a "method" so it does not have end with parenthesis `()`

titanic_df.columns # a list of the names of the columns 
# also an attribute...

# You can rename columns as desired...
# This would make columns named "a" and "b" uppercase
df.rename(columns={'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}, inplace=True)

# The `{'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}` is a "dictionary" `dict()` data type object.
# In dictionary parlance, the lowercase letters in the above example are "keys" 
# and the uppercase letters are the "values" which correspond the to the "keys"

# In this case, the code specifies the columns to be renamed (the keys)
# and what their new names should be (the values).
```

**Observations** are usually organized as rows in a dataset. Each observation represents a single entity upon which data has been measured and recorded. For example, if youâ€™re analyzing a dataset of patients in a hospital, each patient would be an observation.

**Variables** are the different things that can be measured and recorded for each entity, and thus usually correspond to the columns in a dataset. So, the **observation** is comprised of all the values in the columns (or **variables**) of a dataset. 

> These concepts are discussed in more detail, [here](https://www.statology.org/observation-in-statistics/).

We're likely to intuitively think of an "observation" as a single value, and we often analyze the values of a single column of data which tends to further bolsters the concept that an "observation" can be thought of as a single value. Since an "observation" refers to whatever set of variables we're considering, there is not a problem with this simplified view of things at the moment. 

Variables can be [numerical (quantitative) or categorical (qualitative)](https://uniskills.library.curtin.edu.au/numeracy/statistics/data-variable-types/). For instance, a [patient dataset](http://www.statistics4u.info/fundstat_eng/cc_variables.html) might include the variables of age, weight, blood type, etc.

> Missing values in datasets need to be handled carefully during analysis because they can affect the results. Different statistical methods and tools have their own ways of dealing with missing values, either by ignoring, removing them, or filling them in with estimated values.
