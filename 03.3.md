[**Skewness**](https://stats.libretexts.org/Courses/Penn_State_University_Greater_Allegheny/STAT_200%3A_Introductory_Statistics_%28OpenStax%29_GAYDOS/02%3A_Descriptive_Statistics/2.06%3A_Skewness_and_the_Mean_Median_and_Mode) is a measure of the asymmetry of a data distribution. If skewness is present, then it's either left "negative" or right "positive" skew. 

- If the data is spread out more to the left direction then the skew is "negative"
- If the data is spread out more to the right direction then the skew is "positive"

Skewness can be understood in terms of its affect on the relationship between the **mean** and **median**.

- The **mean** is the average of all data points in the dataset.
- The **median** is the middle point of a number set, in which half the numbers are above the median and half are below.

> The median is the 50th percentile of the data so it is the "second quartile" and can be denoted as Q2 similarly to the first and third quartiles Q1 and Q3 (which are the 25th and 75th percentile of the data).

In a **symmetric** distribution, the mean and median are the same. However, when data is skewed, the mean and median will differ.

- In a **positive skew** context, the mean will be greater than the median. This is because the mean is influenced by the high values in the tail of the distribution and gets pulled in the direction of the skew.
- In a ** negative skew** context, the mean will be less than the median. This is because the mean is influenced by the low values in the tail of the distribution and gets pulled in the direction of the skew.

A simple way to remember this relationship is that the mean is 'pulled' in the direction of the skew.
