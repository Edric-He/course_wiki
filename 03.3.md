In statistics, the term **range** refers to the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset, so it provides a simple measure of the spread (or dispersion or variability) of the data. For example, in the set {4, 6, 9, 3, 7}, the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9. So the range is 9 - 3 = 6. 
> The range can sometimes be misleading if the highest and lowest values are extremely exceptional relative to most of the values in the data set, so be careful when considering the range of a numeric variable. For example, the range of salaries is not very representative of most "working class" salaries. 

The **interquartile range (IQR)** is another statistical measure of the spread (or dispersion or variability) of the data. It is defined as [the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/interquartile-range/). In other words, the IQR includes the 50% of data points that are above the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3). The IQR is used to assess the variability where most of your values lie. Larger values indicate that the central portion of your data spread out further, while smaller values show that the middle values cluster more tightly.

A **box plot** is a graphical representation for characterizing the relative statistical spread (or dispersion or variability) of a numerical data distribution around its median. A box plot serves a similar purpose to as **histogram**, but it is a simpler alternative that provides a higher-level summary of numerical data. 

The "box" of a box plot is constructed out of the first (Q1) and third quartiles (Q3) separated by the median (which is the second quartile Q2); so, a box plot shows the the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile with the "box" containing the middle 50% of the data. 

Box plots additionally draw **whiskers** (lines extending from the box) which typically extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) of the first and third quartiles. 

- The **lower whisker** extends to the smallest data point within **1.5 * IQR** below the first quartile.
- The **upper whisker** extends to the largest data point within **1.5 * IQR** above the third quartile.

Data points that fall outside this range of the whiskers are typically termed **outliers** and are plotted as individual points. 

> The term "outliers" is only meant to be suggestive as outliers can mean different things in different context. In the context of a box plot, referring to the points beyond the extent of the whiskers is simply a technical term related to the definitional construction of a box plot.
