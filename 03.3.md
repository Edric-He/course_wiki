A **box plot** is a graphical representation for characterizing the relative statistical spread (or dispersion or variability) of a numerical data distribution around its median. A box plot serves a similar purpose to as **histogram**, but it is a simpler alternative that provides a higher-level summary of numerical data. 

The "box" of a box plot is constructed out of the first (Q1) and third quartiles (Q3) separated by the median (which is the second quartile Q2); so, a box plot shows the the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile with the "box" containing the middle 50% of the data. 

Box plots additionally draw **whiskers** (lines extending from the box) which typically extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) of the first and third quartiles. 

- The **lower whisker** extends to the smallest data point within **1.5 * IQR** below the first quartile.
- The **upper whisker** extends to the largest data point within **1.5 * IQR** above the third quartile.

Data points that fall outside this range of the whiskers are typically termed **outliers** and are plotted as individual points. 

> The term "outliers" is only meant to be suggestive as outliers can mean different things in different context. In the context of a box plot, referring to the points beyond the extent of the whiskers is simply a technical term related to the definitional construction of a box plot.

Box plots are great for comparing the distributions of different groups of data; and, they also clearly indicate the presence of skew in a numerical data set; **but, be careful as box plots cannot represent multimodality in a data set; and, they do not indicate the amount of data they represent without the addition of an explicit annotations indicating this.**
