It is sometimes useful to iterate through a custom list rather than a `range(n)` generator. 
Below, instead of "iterator" `i`, we denote the "iterator" as `x` to emphasize that it's not a "numerical index iterator".
> This is not strictly necessary, since you can name your "iterator" variable whatever you want to and then access it as such in the body of the for loop.

```python
a_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for x in a_list: # note that we don't have to use the `range()` function here!
    print(x)     # we can just "iterate" through the "iterable" list `a_list`!
```

It is additionally sometimes useful to both iterate through a custom list but also still have a "numerical index iterator" as well.
This is done with by wrapping the `enumerate()` function around a list (or tuple) object.

```python
for i,x in enumerate(a_list):
    print(f"Index: {i}") # this useful syntax pastes `i` into the displayed string
    print(f"Value: {x}") # this useful syntax pastes `x` into the displayed string
    print("Iteration Completed")
```

The `enumerate(a_list)` "numerical index iterator" (`i`) to the "iterable" list (`a_list`) and returns it as an enumerate object which the `for` loop understands and unpacks into `i` and `x` at each "iteration" as indicated by the `i,x` syntax. 

One more `for` loop structure that can sometimes be useful is "iterating" through dictionaries based on the `.items()`, `.keys()`, or `.values()` methods of a dictionary.

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
for key in my_dict.keys():
    print(key)

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {value}")

for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)
```
