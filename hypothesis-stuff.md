Introduction to Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis is a fundamental concept in statistics that represents a default position that there is no effect or no difference. It is denoted as H₀.

**Steps in Hypothesis Testing**

1. **Formulate the Null Hypothesis (H₀):** This hypothesis states that there is no effect or no difference.
2. **Formulate the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** This hypothesis states that there is an effect or a difference.
3. **Collect Data and Perform the Test:** Use statistical methods to test the null hypothesis.
4. **Make a Decision:** Based on the statistical analysis, decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.

**Example**

Suppose we want to test if a coin is fair. Our hypotheses would be:

- H₀: The coin is fair (i.e., the probability of heads is 0.5).
- H₁: The coin is not fair (i.e., the probability of heads is not 0.5).

We would then flip the coin many times, collect the data, and use a statistical test to determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
