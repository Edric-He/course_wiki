A **histogram** is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights. It is similar to a **bar plot**, but a histogram instead counts groups of numbers within ranges. That is, the height of each bar shows how many data points fall into each range. For example if you measure the [heights of trees in an orchard](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/histograms.html), you could put the heights data into 
and the heights vary from 100 cm to 350 cm in intervals 50 cm, so a tree that is 260 cm tall would be added to the "250-300" range.  Histograms are a great way to show results of numeric data, such as weight, height, time, etc.

- In a histogram, the **width of the bars (also known as bins)** represents the interval that is used to group the data points. The choice of bin size can greatly affect the resulting histogram and can change the way we interpret the data.

- If the **bin size is too large**, each bar might span a wide range of values, which could obscure important details about how the data is distributed. On the other hand, if the **bin size is too small**, the histogram could become cluttered with many bars, making it difficult to see the overall pattern.

- Choosing an appropriate bin size is a balance between accurately representing the data and maintaining readability. 

To illustrate this, the code below generates two histograms for the same dataset, but with different bin sizes. The first histogram uses a smaller bin size, and the second one uses a larger bin size. As you can see, the histogram with the smaller bin size has more bars, each representing a narrower range of values. In contrast, the histogram with the larger bin size has fewer bars, each representing a wider range of values.


```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Generate a random dataset
np.random.seed(0) # scipy random seeds can be set with numpy
n = 500
data = stats.norm().rvs(size=n)

# Create a histogram with smaller bin size
fig1 = go.Figure(data=[go.Histogram(x=data, nbinsx=50)])
fig1.update_layout(title_text='Histogram with Smaller Bin Size')
fig1.show()

# Create a histogram with larger bin size
fig2 = go.Figure(data=[go.Histogram(x=data, nbinsx=10)])
fig2.update_layout(title_text='Histogram with Larger Bin Size')
fig2.show()
```

> In `px.histogram` (from `import plotly.express as px`) the parameter specifying the number of bins is `nbins` (not `nbinsx`); whereas, in `seaborn` and `matplotlib` (and hence `pandas`) the parameter is just `bins`. Here's some nifty code that would let you think about "widths" instead of number of bins, which is probably more useful sometimes.
>
> ```python
> import math
> bin_width = 0.5  # Choose your desired bin width
> nbinsx = math.ceil((data.max() - data.min()) / bin_width) # or `nbins` or `bins` if you're using another
> ```
>
> - Also... please note that the actual bin width in the histogram might not be exactly the same as the desired bin width due to the way that `Plotly` [automatically calculates the bin edges](https://community.plotly.com/t/histogram-bin-size-with-plotly-express/38927)

In statistics, the term **range** refers to the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset, so it provides a simple measure of the spread (or dispersion or variability) of the data. For example, in the set {4, 6, 9, 3, 7}, the lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9. So the range is 9 - 3 = 6. 
> The range can sometimes be misleading if the highest and lowest values are extremely exceptional relative to most of the values in the data set, so be careful when considering the range of a numeric variable. For example, the range of salaries is not very representative of most "working class" salaries. 

The **interquartile range (IQR)** is another statistical measure of the spread (or dispersion or variability) of the data. It is defined as [the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the data](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/interquartile-range/). In other words, the IQR includes the 50% of data points that are above the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3). The IQR is used to assess the variability where most of your values lie. Larger values indicate that the central portion of your data spread out further, while smaller values show that the middle values cluster more tightly.
