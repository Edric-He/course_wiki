The `.describe()` method provides descriptive statistics that summarize **numerical data** in terms of its location (or position) and scale (or spread). Its provides mean, standard deviation, median (50th percentile), quartiles (25th and 75th percentile), and minimum and maximum values.

> The statistic calculations are based on the non-missing values in the data set, and the number of such non-missing values used to calculate the statistics is given by the "count" value returned from `.describe()`.

The `[column_name].value_counts()` method counts the number of each unique value in a column (named `column_name`). This method is used for **categorical data** to understand the distribution of categories within a feature. It does not count missing values by default, but it can include them in the counts by using `dropna=False`.

Hereâ€™s a demonstration using the Titanic dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset 
titanic_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv')

# Use df.describe() to get descriptive statistics for numerical features
numerical_stats = titanic_df.describe()

# Use df.value_counts() on a categorical column, for example, 'Embarked'
embarked_counts = titanic_df['embarked'].value_counts()

print(numerical_stats)
print(embarked_counts)
```
