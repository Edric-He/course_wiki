In statistics, sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. It is often impractical or impossible to collect data from an entire population, so we rely on samples to make inferences.

**Why Sampling is Important**

- **Cost-Effective:** Collecting data from a sample is usually less expensive than collecting data from the entire population.
- **Time-Saving:** Sampling can save time as data collection and analysis are faster with smaller datasets.
- **Feasibility:** In some cases, it's impossible to measure the entire population, so sampling is the only practical approach.
