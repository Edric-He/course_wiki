The df.describe() method provides descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a dataset’s distribution, excluding NaN values. It’s typically used for numerical data to get an overview of the mean, median, quartiles, and other statistical measures.

The df.value_counts() method returns a Series containing counts of unique values. This method is used for categorical data to understand the distribution of categories within a feature. It does not count NaN values by default, but you can include them by setting dropna=False.

Here’s a demonstration using the Titanic dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset (assuming it's stored as 'titanic.csv')

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv
titanic_df = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csv')

# Use df.describe() to get descriptive statistics for numerical features
numerical_stats = titanic_df.describe()

# Use df.value_counts() on a categorical column, for example, 'Embarked'
embarked_counts = titanic_df['Embarked'].value_counts()

print(numerical_stats)
print(embarked_counts)
```
