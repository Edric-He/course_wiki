NumPy is a `Python` library that contains the most efficient versions of standard numerical routines.
For example, a NumPy `np.array` is preferred over a list for its speed and functionality in numerical tasks.
The NumPy library is imported and a `np.array` is created from a list object as follows.

```python
import numpy as np
example_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

An example numerical task that can be done with NumPy is to select a random value from an `np.array` object as follows.

```python
random_element = np.random.choice(example_array)
random_element
```
