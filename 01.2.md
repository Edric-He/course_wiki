```python
import pandas as pd

# read a local file
pd.read_csv("./path/to/filename.csv") # "." denotes the "current directory"
# the "csv" file "filename.csv" is in subfolders of the "current directory"

# read an online file
pd.read_csv("https://www.url.com/path/to/filename.csv")
```

### Using URL links

When accessing an online file, you must link to an actual "raw" `.csv` file.
- This link "looks like" an actual `.csv` file, **but it is not**: [https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csv](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csv)
    - If you follow the link you'll see it's some sort of webpage that visualizes a `.csv` file, but it is not the actual "raw" `.csv` file.
- Here is the link to the actual "raw" `.csv` file that can be found on the above page: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv)
   - If you follow the link you'll see it's now the actual "raw" `.csv` file.

```python
# will not work
failing_url = "https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csv"
titanic_df = pd.read_csv(failing_url) 
# does not access an actual "raw" `.csv` file

# will work
working_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
titanic_df = pd.read_csv(working_url) 
# links directly to an actual "raw" `.csv` file
```

### Extensions

Here are some parameters of the `pd.read_csv` method that can be used to address somewhat common special cases...
- `encoding` for different character sets
- `sep` for different file types
- `skiprows` and `names` to control column names (and see more [here](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pandas-read-csv-tsv/))
