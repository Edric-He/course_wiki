```python
import pandas as pd

# read a local file
pd.read_csv("./path/to/filename.csv") # "." denotes the "current directory"
# the "csv" file "filename.csv" is in subfolders of the "current directory"

# read an online file
pd.read_csv("https://www.url.com/path/to/filename.csv")
# must link to a csv file
```

Parameters for somewhat common special cases...
- `encoding` for different character sets
- `sep` for different file types
- `skiprows` and `names` to control column names (and see more [here](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-pandas-read-csv-tsv/))
