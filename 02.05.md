FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge that’s often used to teach basic programming concepts like loops and conditionals. 
In the FizzBuzz problem, you loop through a range of numbers, and then do the follow for each number.
1. If the number is divisible by 3, you print “Fizz”.
2. If the number is divisible by 5, you print “Buzz”.
3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print “FizzBuzz”.
4. If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, you print the number itself.

Here’s an example FizzBuzz program that illustrates the use of `if` and `else` conditional statements for logical flow control with comments explaining each step.

```python
for i in range(1, 101):  # Loop from 1 to 100
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:  # Check if divisible by both 3 and 5
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:  # Check if divisible by 3
        print("Fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:  # Check if divisible by 5
        print("Buzz")
    else:  # If not divisible by 3 or 5
        print(i)
```

1. The `for` loop sets up the iteration (from `1` to `100` in this example).
2. The first `if` statement checks for the first condition (divisible by both 3 and 5).
    1. the **modulus** operation `%` returns the remainder of "i divided by 3"; so, it's just an operation like `i+3`, `i-3`, or `i/3`; but, if the remainder is `0` then it means that "i divides by 3 perfectly"
    2. The `and` construction in `i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0` means that both `i % 3 == 0` AND `i % 5 == 0` must be `True` for the `if` statement to succeed
    3. If the `if` statement succeeds (because its "argument is `True`) then the "body" (the indented code block beneath the `if` statement) of the `if` statement is executed
The elif (else if) statements check for the subsequent conditions (divisible by 3, and then 5).
The else statement covers the case where none of the above conditions are true.
The print() function outputs the result based on the condition that’s met.
This structure allows the program to make decisions at each iteration, demonstrating how logical flow control works in a for loop using if and else statements. The program will print out a mix of numbers and the words “Fizz”, “Buzz”, and “FizzBuzz” based on the divisibility of each number. It’s a simple yet effective way to understand these fundamental programming concepts.





if/else conditional statements [perhaps with x in b_list or i % 2 == 0 treat evens/odds differently]
Note "similarity" to try/except/pass?
