In pandas, **boolean** values are represented as `True` or `False`. When you use the `.isna()` method on a DataFrame, it returns a DataFrame of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding element is missing and `False` otherwise.

**Coercion** refers to the conversion of one data type into another. In the case of `df.isna().sum()`, coercion happens implicitly when the `.sum()` method is called. The `.sum()` method treats `True` as `1` and `False` as `0` and sums these integer values. This is a form of coercion where boolean values are coerced into integers for the purpose of performing arithmetic operations.

Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a DataFrame with some missing values
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, np.nan, 3],
    'B': [4, 5, np.nan]
})

# Apply isna() to get a DataFrame of boolean values
bool_df = df.isna()

# Coerce boolean values to integers and sum them
missing_values_sum = bool_df.sum()

print(bool_df)
print(missing_values_sum)
```

In the output, `bool_df` shows that in data in the DataFrame is boolean after applying `.isna()`. The `missing_values_sum` shows the sum of missing values per column, where `True` values have been coerced to `1` and summed up.
