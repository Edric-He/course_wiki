**Theoretical Populations**

In statistics, a theoretical population is an idealized group of data points that represent a perfect example of a distribution. It is not always possible to collect data from the entire population, so theoretical populations help statisticians to make inferences and predictions.

**Creating a Theoretical Population**

To create a theoretical population, we use mathematical functions to define a distribution. In this section, we will demonstrate how to create and visualize a theoretical population using Python.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Import Libraries:** We need to import the necessary libraries to handle statistical functions and plotting. We use plotly.express for visualization, scipy.stats for statistical functions, numpy for numerical operations, and pandas for data manipulation.

```python
import plotly.express as px
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

2. **Define Parameters:** We define the mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) of our normal distribution. These parameters determine the shape and spread of the distribution.

```python
mu, sigma = 1, 0.33
```

3. **Create Distribution:** Using the stats.norm function, we create a normal distribution with our specified mean and standard deviation.

```python
my_theoretical_population = stats.norm(loc=mu, scale=sigma)
```

4. **Generate Data Points:** We generate a range of values over which we want to evaluate our distribution. The np.linspace function creates an array of values evenly spaced within a specified range.

```python
support = np.linspace(-1, 3, 100)
```
5. **Calculate Density:** We calculate the probability density function (PDF) of our normal distribution over the range of values. The PDF gives us the density of the distribution at each point.

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': support, 'density': my_theoretical_population.pdf(support)})
```

6. **Visualize Distribution:** We use Plotly Express to create a line plot of our theoretical population. The plot displays the density of the distribution across the range of values.

```python
px.line(df, x='x', y='density')
```

**Complete Code Example**

Here is the complete code to create and visualize a theoretical population:

```python
import plotly.express as px
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the mean and standard deviation
mu, sigma = 1, 0.33

# Create the theoretical population
my_theoretical_population = stats.norm(loc=mu, scale=sigma)

# Generate a range of values
support = np.linspace(-1, 3, 100)

# Calculate the density of the distribution at each point
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': support, 'density': my_theoretical_population.pdf(support)})

# Create a line plot of the theoretical population
px.line(df, x='x', y='density')
```
