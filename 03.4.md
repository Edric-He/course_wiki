**Modality** is pretty easy to understand as it simply refers to the general "peaks" that may be present in a numerical data set. 
> These "peaks" are often informally referred to as "modes" but these should not be confused with the technical definition of **mode** which refers to the most common unique value in a data set.

An interesting "special case" of unimodal distributions is the **normal distribution**.
The figures below illustrates the quantiles (Q1 and Q3) for a normal distribution based on the corresponding boxplot.
The "sigma" Ïƒ character in the figure below signifies the **standard deviation** and the bottom most figure shows the percentiles that correspond to different multiplicative ranges of the standard deviation.
