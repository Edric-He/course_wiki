A `tuple` is an object containing an "sequential collection" of "things" that is created and represented with round brackets.
Tuples are **immutable**, which means that after a tuple is created you cannot change, add, or remove items; so, tuples's are ideal for representing data that shouldnâ€™t really change, like birthday dates or geolocation coordinates of natural landmarks.

```python
example_tuple = (1, 'apple', 3.14, 1) # tuples can contain duplicate elements
example_tuple
```

A `list` is another kind of object containing a "sequential collection" of "things" that is created and represented with square brackets.
Unlike tuples, lists are **mutable**, which means they can be altered after their creation. If you don't want to recreate a tuple from scratch each time you need to change your collection of things, then you should use a list!

```python
example_list = [1, 'banana', 7.77, 1] # lists can also contain duplicate elements like tuples
example_list.append('new item') # here we add a new element onto the list
# to do the same thing with a tuple you'd have to completely create a completely new tuple 
# as `example_tuple_update = (1, 'banana', 7.77, 1, 'new item')`
example_list
```

A `dict` ("dictionary") is an object that uses a "key-value" pairs "look up structure" of "things" instead of a "sequential collection" organization that are created and represented using "key-value" pairs inside of curly braces (as demonstrated below).
Dictionaries are **mutable** like lists, but each "key" of a dictionary is **unique** (so it uniquely references its corresponding "value"). Since a `dict` is based on a "look up" system, it is a so-called **unordered** object. This means that unlike tuples and lists which always remember their sequential order, dictionaries do not maintain their order of insertion and can change the order of items when the dictionary is modified.

```python
example_dict = {'id': 1, 'name': 'orange', 'price': 5.99} # There cannot be duplicate "keys" but there could be duplicate "values"
example_dict['quantity'] = 10
```
